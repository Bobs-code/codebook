# Codewars

Creating a place to store all my codewars challenges that I have completed. Copying the challenge from codewars, I create a for each challenge. Over time this might change. The question is whether I want to store a ton of challenges in a single file or to store a ton of challenges as separate files in a single directory based on the difficulty of the challenges.
