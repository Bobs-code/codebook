# Overview

This codebook will be used to compile important info and examples of code concepts, syntax, and other notes I am learning. I will use it both as a reference and a journal wherein I relflect on those things I'm learing. 


* *note on approach* - I will go against the grain here and attempt to learn multiple languages concurrently. I understand the advice that this is a bad idea. But I need to try it and fail to figure this out. JavaScript, PHP, Go, C. 


There are specific resources I will use that I will stick to during the course of my learning various subjects(*an X denotes completed resource*): 

1. JavaScipt
* Learning With Leon's Resources
* LinkedIn Learning
* Eloquent JavaScript

2. PHP
* Laracasts
* LinkedIn

3. Go
* HeadFirst Go

4. C 
* HeadFirst C

## Directory Reference

* Syntax and Method Basics - Will use a single markdown file to collect syntax basics for each language. For example, arrays.md will have code examples for each language specifying the array syntax for that language

* Code Playground - these will be places where the syntax can be modified and written differently. Here is where the practice will happen and thus will necessitate different files for the different languages.
